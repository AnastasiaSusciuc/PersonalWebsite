## A journal capturing a life driven by curiosity and a desire for growth

I am Anastasia, a computer scientist with a passion for entrepreneurship and maths. 

I built an app to help kids learn to handwrite [Rito Kids](https://www.ritokids.com){:target="_blank"} 
and a platform to make access to qualitative education in Romania more accessible [Meditatii.ro](https://meditatii.ro/despre-noi){:target="_blank"}. 
Check out [The story of Rito Kids](/blog/rito-kids) and [The story of MateNow.ro, turned Meditatii.ro](MateNow.ro).
